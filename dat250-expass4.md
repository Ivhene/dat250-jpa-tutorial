# Problems
There were a few problems I ran into with this assignemnt, but it was mainly due to me not properly understanding the assignment. The main issues where I didnt realize to begin with that I had to find a database to connect to and I also struggled to understand what I was trying to do. JPA itself was very simple for me, as I have done it in DAT107, DAT108 and DAT109 before. I also ended up using the database that was provided for all of these courses in the past, as I still have access to that. 

# Code

# Database
As I mentioned, I used the database that was provided for other HVL courses earlier. That database is a PostgreSQL database, available in the cloud as long as the connection is provided. I inspected the database using PGAdmin. The following datatables where created:
